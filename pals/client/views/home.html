      Welcome to PALS
    </h3>

    <p>
    The Protocol for the Analysis of Land Surface models is a web application for evaluating
    and benchmarking land surface models. It provides standards for model input/output formatting,
    driving data for modelling experiments, as well as a wide range of automated diagnostic
    performance measures once model output is uploaded. <a>More about PALS features.</a>
